EC2:
Ondemand: reserve instance for hourly basis
Spot: reserve instance by bidding.. if instance price increases from bid price then instance will be removed
Reserved: it will reserve instance for 1yr to 3yrs..Pay like upfront fee.Longer years less price
how to get EC2 instance metadata: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

EBS:
it is stoage for EC2 instances. Types:
1. General Purpose SSD: upto (10000Ipos)
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD(more than 10000 iops)
3. Magnetic: Cheap
Notes:
Cant mount one ebs volume to multiple EC2 instnace. 
If need to use in multiple EC2 instances then use EFS instead.

Elastic Load Balancing:
two types:
1. EC2-VPC [port 1-65535]
2. Classic [port 25,80,443465,587,1024-65535]
It support protocols are: Http,Https,TCP,SSL(secure TCP)

S3:
one file size can be of 0bytes to 5TB
S3 has unique namespace, ie, bucket name should be unique globally
It is object based storage. Consist of-
1. Key-Name of the object
2. Value-is data in form of sequence of bytes
3. VersionID: for file versioning
4. Metadata: data abt data like date created etc.
5. Subresources: a) Access Control List b)Torrents

S3-Storage tier-
a)S3 
b)S3-IA(Infrequently Accessed)low fee than s3 but retieval charge apply
c) Reduced Redundancy Storage: low durability of 99.99%

Configure LifeCycle in S3
1. Action on Current Version
2. Action on Previous Version
